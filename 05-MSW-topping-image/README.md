## Toppings Images

- Use scoops as a model
  - type out rather than copy/paste for better learning
- add handler for /toppings route
- handler can returen three toppings

```react
[
  { name: "Cherries", imagePath: "/images/cherries.png" },
  { name: "M&Ms", imagePath: "/images/m-and-ms.png" },
  { name: "Hot fudge", imagePath: "/images/hot-fudge.png" },
]
```
